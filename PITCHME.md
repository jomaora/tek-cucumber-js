Tool for running automated tests, but a little bit more...

A single source of truth
    - Merging specifications and tests documentations
    - Documentation in test is related to code, so it will be updated documentation.

#### Good news?

Every browser ships with an implementation of an HTTP cache

#### 304 Etag

Validating cached responses with ETags

![Simple Etag](assets/img/http-cache-control.png)

#VSLIDE

#### How to?

The only thing left to do is to ensure that the server is providing the necessary ETag tokens.

ExpressJs & express.static enable Etag by default

#### Cache-Control

Each resource can define its caching policy via the Cache-Control HTTP header.

#VSLIDE

#### no-cache" and "no-store"

no-cache: need revalidation

no-store: disallow storage

#VSLIDE

#### "public" vs. "private"

public: cache everywhere

private: cache on browser

#VSLIDE 

#### "max-age"
This directive specifies the maximum time in seconds that the fetched response is allowed to be reused from the time of the request.

For example, "max-age=60" indicates that the response can be cached and reused for the next 60 seconds.

RFC: Max 1 year

#VSLIDE

### Cache-Control directives examples

Cache-Control Header | Explanation
------------ | -------------
max-age=86400 | Response can be cached by browser and any intermediary caches (that is, it's "public") for up to 1 day (60 seconds x 60 minutes x 24 hours).
private, max-age=600 | Response can be cached by the clientâ€™s browser only for up to 10 minutes (60 seconds x 10 minutes).
no-store | Response is not allowed to be cached and must be fetched in full on every request.

### Client Caching and quick updates

![Quick win](assets/img/http-cache-hierarchy.png)

#VSLIDE

### Caching checklist

* Use consistent URLs
* Ensure that the server provides a validation token (ETag)
* Identify which resources can be cached by intermediaries
* Determine the optimal cache lifetime for each resource
* Determine the best cache hierarchy for your site
* Minimize churn
